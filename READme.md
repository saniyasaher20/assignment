# My Comments
- For better speed, webp image format should be used. I can convert images into webp in Photoshop.
- The font used in the design ('ITC Avant Garde Gothic Std') is a premium font. So I have used a very similar free font from 'googlefonts.com'.
- The carousel in the section "First choice of procurement partners across global" is centered, instead of left aligned, because I need more clarity about the design of the carousel after user interaction. 
- I use scss, because it makse styling more readable and maintanable.
- Google map is embeded with original location
- Website is responsive as per the provided breakpoints
